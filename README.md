# Rewriting

> Source code to the paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01467](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01467)

The previous version of source-code has some weird bugs under certain situations. I sincerely apologize for any misunderstanding or confusion that article may have caused. 

Due to some issues such as the ad-hoc developments, I am now rewriting the whole code in TensorFlow and will release it by 20 November, 2016. 

Initial experiments with the new code shows that the state features comprising weight statistics and the reward funcitons are effective.
