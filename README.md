# Withdrawn

> Source code to the paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01467](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01467)

The previous version of source-code has a crucial bug (the configuration of epsilon is not reasonable), which makes the claims in the paper invalid. I sincerely apologize for any misunderstanding or confusion that article may have caused. 

I will keep this repo as a warning sign to myself.
