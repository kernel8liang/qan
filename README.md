# Withdrawn

> Source code to the paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01467](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01467)

The previous version of source-code has some weird bugs under certain situations. Specifically, the `epsilon` hyperparameter in the original paper when testing is set to 0.05, which means the `restart` action is due to random exploration but not based on the learned policy. 

I've been always trying to make my results reproducible as suggested in [Challenges in irreproducible research](http://www.nature.com.libproxy1.nus.edu.sg/news/reproducibility-1.17552). It's me who first found the bug and I chose to withdraw it after double check. 

I sincerely apologize for any misunderstanding or confusion that article may have caused.
